\chapter*{Abstract}

Motion planning for legged robots is a challenging problem and remains an open area of research. Particular difficulties arise from effective underactuation, the mechanism complexity, as well as nonlinear and hybrid dynamics.
A common approach is to decompose this problem into smaller sub-problems that are solved sequentially. Recent research indicates that using a local optimal control solver, namely Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), instead of Inverse Kinematics/Inverse Dynamics, produces more efficient motions, with lower forces and impacts. 

This master thesis contributes by applying, evaluating and extending DDP-based whole-body trajectory optimization, pursuing three objectives: 
First, we develop an approach to constrain the optimal control problem allowing DDP to produce inherently balanced motions. 
Second, we evaluate our approach for quasi-static and dynamic motions in a real-time physics simulation and in real-world experiments on the lightweight and biologically inspired RH5 humanoid robot.
Third, we examine the limits of the derived whole-body planning approach and the system design via solving highly-dynamic movements.
